Hello! My name is Ariane Thomas, and I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Iowa. My research uses genetic data and skeletal biology to study the history of dogs and their relationship with humans. I focus on how humans of the past controlled and managed dog populations of North America, but I am interested in all things dogs!  My dog research is a great way to advocate for my other academic passions: reproducible data analyses and scientific literacy of evolution and genetics. I am a committed science communicator with a goal of improving the public perception of science.
