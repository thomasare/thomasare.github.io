Effects of genetic variation on cancer phenotypes
======

Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-associated deaths among women, but we know very little about the underlying genetic variation and how it affects treatment outcomes. Recently, I finished a project that found that individuals with mutated BRCA genes often also have mutated TP53 genes and that these specific genotypes affect transcription levels under treatment conditions. I am now exploring the link between copy number variation in mitochondrial DNA and ovarian and uterine cancers.
