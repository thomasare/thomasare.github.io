Genetic history of European dogs in the Americas
======

Recent genetic studies have found that many dog lineages that have been in the Americas for over 10,000 years no longer exist today. This substantial loss of dog ancestry has been attributed to European colonization of the Americas, but it is unclear when European dogs replaced indigenous American dogs and the degree to which these dogs were allowed to interbreed with each other. My work seeks to clarify this replacement using ancient DNA from archaeological dogs at early colonial sites. Unfortunately, not every dog breed ever created still exists. Major world conflicts of the last century, like World War I and World War II, had more than human casualties - dogs were also affected. In the years since, breeding has become more intensive and some breeds had to be recreated after the original breed was lost. Therefore, colonial dogs may represent a different population of dogs that is not genetically represented in modern times. I am also using DNA analysis to estimate if there is genetic continuity between early colonial dogs and contemporary breeds.

Effects of genetic variation on cancer phenotypes
======

Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-associated deaths among women, but we know very little about the underlying genetic variation and how it affects treatment outcomes. Recently, I finished a project that found that individuals with mutated BRCA genes often also have mutated TP53 genes and that these specific genotypes affect transcription levels under treatment conditions. I am now exploring the link between copy number variation in mitochondrial DNA and ovarian and uterine cancers.
