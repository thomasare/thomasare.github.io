Changes in dog morphology throughout time
======

Dogs have existed for 40,000-20,000 years. but most of the modern dog breeds we know and love today were created within the last 500 - 400 years. This leaves a tremendously large gap in our knowledge about the human relationship with dogs. How did humans thousands of years ago manage their dogs? How did this management affect dog morphology? I have collected osteometric and 3D data of North American dogs spanning 10,000 years of time to investigate how geography, time, and culture affects differences in dog body size and shape.
